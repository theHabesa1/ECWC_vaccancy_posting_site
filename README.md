# ECWC_vaccancy_posting_site
this is a PHP built site to manage open vacancy posting on the companies official website . this was one of the projects i did by the time i was working there.

Features the website hold
--> an admin panel to post the jobs, edit and delete them.
--> user registration and login form to acces the postes
--> jobs displayed as a card or as a table i would suggest you delete the table it was one of the reuiremnt while i was working there but you can delete it
